# Becoming a Full-Stack Developer
### A Detailed Study Roadmap

Becoming a full-stack developer is a journey that requires a broad understanding of both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development. Here's a detailed study roadmap that should help you become a full-stack developer specializing in Spring Boot (Java), Angular (TypeScript), and Ionic.

## Phase 1: Basics
### 1. Programming Fundamentals

- Concepts: Algorithms, Data Structures, and basic problem-solving.
- Languages: Learn basics of Java and JavaScript & Typescript.

### 2. Web Fundamentals

- HTML: Understand all common HTML tags, form, and validations.
- CSS: Styling, layout, box model, grid systems, flex, animations, and Responsive Web Design.
- JavaScript (ES6): Understand the DOM, JSON, AJAX, Promises, async/await, and ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and modules.
###3. Version Control System

- Git:Basic commands, branches, and workflows.

## Phase 2: Back-end Development (Java with Spring Boot)
### 1. Advanced Java

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
Functional Programming: Lambdas and Streams.
- Concurrency: Threads, synchronization, and locks.
- Collections: List, Map, Set, Queue, etc.
- Generics and Templates
- Error Handling: Exception types, try-catch blocks.
### 2. Database

- SQL: Understand all CRUD operations, joins, and indexes.
- NoSQL: Basic understanding of NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
- JDBC: Connecting Java with databases.
- ORM: Basics of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate.
### 3. Spring Boot

- Dependency Injection
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Understanding of REST APIs (HTTP methods, status codes, etc.)
- Microservices with Spring Boot
- Unit and Integration testing in Spring Boot

### 4. Maven/Gradle

- Understanding of building and managing projects using Maven or Gradle.
## Phase 3: Front-end Development (JavaScript with Angular/Ionic)
### 1. TypeScript

- Strong Types, Interfaces, Generics, Enums.
- Classes and OOP in TypeScript.
- Decorators.
- Modules and Namespaces.
### 2. Angular

- Angular CLI
- Components, Modules, and Services
- Directives and Pipes
- RxJS and Observables
- Angular Forms
- Routing
- State Management with NgRx
- Unit and Integration testing in Angular
- Nx Workspace, Monorepo, and Micro Frontends

### 3. Ionic

- Understanding of hybrid mobile app development.
- Ionic CLI
- UI Components
- Navigation
- Ionic Native
## Phase 4: Full Stack Integration
### 1. Security

- Authentication and Authorization
- Basic Auth
- OAuth2 and JWT
### 2. Deployment and DevOps

- Docker: Understanding of containerization and basics of Docker.
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration (optional, but recommended).
- CI/CD: Understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- Cloud: AWS/Azure/GCP - Basic understanding of cloud providers to host applications.
### 3. Advanced Concepts

- Microservices: API Gateway, service discovery.
- Performance: Caching, Pagination, and Auditing.
- WebSocket: Real-time communication between client and server.
### 4. Projects

- Build small projects like a CRUD application, to-do list, or a blog.
- Build a larger, complex application integrating all the above technologies.

Finally, remember that the best way to learn programming is by doing. Theoretical knowledge is important, but make sure to apply what you learn by coding your own projects. This will not only solidify your understanding but also provide you with a portfolio to show potential employers.
