### About the Seminar

This seminar was a platform to explore how Full Stack Development beautifully connects `Desire` and `Means`, transforming our innate craving to create into practical solutions.

Read more about the seminar [here](./docs/about.md).

### Hands on Code

During the seminar we wrote a full stack code. Where we were able to do CRUD operations on an `Employee` table stored in a `MySQL Database` from an `Angular` application.

We exposed 4 Rest endpoints using `Spring Boot` and consumed the same in a service layer in `Angular`.

The code is available in the [repository](https://github.com/umun-tech/demystifying-full-stack-development-24-may-2023) itself.

You need to do [these](./docs/hands-on.md) steps to run the code.

### Presentation

### Roadmap to Full Stack Development

We have also created a roadmap to Full Stack Development. You can find it [here](./docs/roadmap.md).

### Resources

We have also compiled a list of resources that you can use to learn Full Stack Development. You can find it [here](./docs/resources.md).
